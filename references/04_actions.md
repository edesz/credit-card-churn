## 4. Actions Being Informed by Project Goal

## Objective

This section will discuss actions to be taken to address the goal (problem of reducing the rate of customer churn).

## Actions

### Identification of the Action

The intervention, or action, is to proactively contact (target) customers at risk of churn during a **certain period in the future** in order to get them to reverse their decision before the end of **that period**, thereby improving customer loyalty.

(optional) Characterizing at-risk customers allows the client to know how to target them. This will allow the client to target data-driven interventions at the at-risk customers by implementing proactive strategies to retain them.

### Goal Informed by Action

Reduce customer churn rate.

### Client that will Execute this Action

Manager of credit card division.

### Recipient of Action

Existing credit card customers.

### Frequency of Executing Action

At-risk clients will be contacted one or more times during a **certain period in the future**. The exact number of times is not known but it is at the discretion of the client.

### Channels Ueed to Execute Action

All channels available to the bank will be deployed

1. in-person
2. digital
3. telephone

### Resource or Capital Constraints

(optional) If churn is to be predicted in approximately 1,500 random but representative customers then the top 200 customers can be contacted (targeted) due to budgeting constraints.

### Ethical Issues Associated With Action

We assume the bank complies with industry constraints and policies when targeting at-risk customers.

### Other Useful Info about Action

We assume

1. Focused targeting using outputs of a predictive model have not been tested.
2. Any required approvals before acting are internal to the bank and are beyond our control
3. The length of time before this action bears fruit is variable. Some customers will revert (from churning) immediately, while others will take time (days or weeks) before reverting.
