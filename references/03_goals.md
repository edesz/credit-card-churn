## Goals

### Business Goals and Constraints

The goal of this project is to reduce the number (or rate) of customers who are likely to churn during **a certain period in the future**.

At-risk customers are those showing signs of likely canceling their credit card services (churning) in the future. The project's goal can be acheived by identifying and characterizing at-risk customers, in order to efficiently target them in an attempt to revert their decision.

Due to budgeting constraints, at most 200 at-risk customers can be contacted (targeted) **certain period in the future**.
